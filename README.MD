#PART 1:
 
Ok let’s start with git What’s Git? Git is free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. 
You could download git here https://git-scm.com/downloads . 
webstorm: idle a visual code that lets you link with github to store, sumit, and paired lines of codes.
 You can download webstorm through Jetstorm but to do that you have to apply for a student license. Sending you a photo of your College Id to get it. 
This is the link https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students where you can download webstorm. 
Now let's set up your github account, to set up your account go to this link https://github.com/join to create it.
 Now lets connect github with webstorm. 
Open your webstom app on your computer, when it's open press (ctrl+alt+s) to be able to go to the settings of webstorm.
 Look for version control and then click on GIT from the left side. 
Make sure that Webstorm is connected to Git. 
The path in the location box should be C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe then click test. 
Click exit then click on create new project. 
On the top left corner click on file, new, HTML FIle. 
Make some changes to the code. 
Next step go to github and click on create new repository. 
Make the repository click and add the readme file. Then click on create. To import a repository from github.
 From webstorm go to VCS then checkout from version control then click on git and type the name of the github repository  and the parth name. 
To add the project to github click on vcs and then click on import into version control then click on share projects on Github. 
After clicking share, a message will appear “Successfully shared project on GitHub”.
Now go to your project on webstorm and make some changes. 
Go to vcs then git and push the file by pressing (Ctrl+shift+K). 
Then click on push then a window will appear then click on merge.
 Now finally when you go to github the changes that were made in webstorm will appear on github. Well done!!!

Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

<b>Branch:</b> A branch is a version of your repository, or in other words, an independent line of development. A repository can contain multiple branches,
<b>Clone:</b> is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo in a new directory, at another location. 
<b>Commit:</b> changes locally﻿ As your changes are ready to be committed, select the corresponding files or an entire changelist.
<b>Fetch: </b>a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository. git fetch is used in conjunction with git remote
<b>GIT:</b>  Git is free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development
<b>Github:</b> is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.
<b>Merge:</b> is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by the git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
<b>Merge</b> Conflict: happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. Git can often resolve differences between branches and merge them automatically.
<b>Push:</b> is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
<b>Pull:</b> pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content
<b>Remote:</b> A remote repository in Git, also called a remote, is a Git repository that's hosted on the Internet or another network.
<b>Repository:</b> A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.
